# go-game (package "goga")

Game engine written in Go using OpenGL and GLFW. Mostly for 2D rendering, but also capable of rendering 3D, providing everything to get you started.
**Under heavy development, do not use yet!**

## Install

```
go get github.com/DeKugelschieber/go-game
```

## Usage

*WIP*

You can find some examples within the demo folder. For full reference visit: https://godoc.org/github.com/DeKugelschieber/go-game

## Dependencies

* https://github.com/go-gl/gl
    - 4.5-core
* https://github.com/go-gl/glfw
    - 3.1

To use an older GL version, you need to replace the GL imports in package goga. It should mostly be compatible down to 3.x.
